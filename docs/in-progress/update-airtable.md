# Update Airtable

Access to the Allocations API is granted to an organization via API keys. Each API key is tied to an
organization and has full access to the API on behalf of that organization.

## Get an API Key

API keys can be generated from the Allocations Dashboard on the [API Settings page](https://dashboard.allocations.com).

## Using an API Key

The API key should be used as a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header on each API request.

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```
